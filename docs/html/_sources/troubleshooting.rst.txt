    The Chrome Browser is unable to connect


* The P1125 LED must be solid RED in order for the browser to connect.
* Is the LED on the P1125 blinking ORANGE?  If the blinking ORANGE does not stop after
  about a minute from power up, a fatal error has occurred.  You may try and remove
  power, wait 10seconds and then re-apply power.
* Is the LED off? If so, remove power for 10seconds and then re-apply power.
* Confirm the P1125 is connected to the same network as your remote computer.

  * Try to `ping` the P1125 from a terminal

    Resetting the P1125 SD card software manually

* A terminal to the P1125 is required, which can be done via `ssh` or with a local setup.
* For `ssh` connections,

  * the username is `pi` and the password is `pi`
  * the hostname or the IP address of the device needs to be known. See :ref:`P1125 IP Address`
  * the IP address is a more reliable method

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ssh pi@192.168.0.23
        ... enter password
        pi@p1125-f85e:~ $ sudo ./update.sh
        ... ignore any output, including errors and warnings
        pi@p1125-f85e:~ $ sudo ./restart.sh
        ... ignore any output, including errors and warnings
