    P1125 does not start, the LED blinks RED forever.

* If this occurs it probably means the P1125 was not able to connect to a network.

* Getting logs is the best way to get help.  Insert a USB stick into the P1125 and see if a
  `p1125` folder is created and contains logs. It may be wise to remove an existing folder first,
  to make sure the created folder is current.  Send those logs to `p1125@sistemi.ca`.

  * Included in the case is a USB stick that can be used to get P1125 logs.  Most USB
    sticks will work, but some users have had trouble with some brands of USB sticks.
