    Resetting the P1125 SD card software manually

* A terminal to the P1125 is required, which can be done via `ssh` or with a local setup.
* For `ssh` connections,

  * the username is `pi` and the password is `pi`
  * the hostname or the IP address of the device needs to be known. See :ref:`P1125 IP Address`
  * the IP address is a more reliable method

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ssh pi@192.168.0.23
        ... enter password
        pi@p1125-f85e:~ $ sudo ./update.sh
        ... ignore any output, including errors and warnings
        pi@p1125-f85e:~ $ sudo ./restart.sh
        ... ignore any output, including errors and warnings


  * after ~60 seconds the LED should be solid RED indicating P1125 is ready to be accessed.

.. code-block:: text

    P1125 does not start, the LED blinks RED forever.

* If this occurs it means the application was not able to talk successfully to the hardware.

  * Note that blinking AMBER is okay and means the P1125 has entered hotspot mode.
    See :ref:`LED Status`

* Getting logs is the best way to get help.  Insert a USB stick into the P1125 and see if a
  `p1125` folder is created and contains logs. It may be wise to remove an existing folder first,
  to make sure the created folder is current.  Send those logs to `p1125@sistemi.ca`.

  * Included in the case is a USB stick that can be used to get P1125 logs.  Most USB
    sticks will work, but some users have had trouble with some brands of USB sticks.

* Try to reset the SD manually by following the `ssh` steps above.

    How can I create a fresh SD Card image?

.. index:: SD Card

* The USB stick included in the case includes a backup SD card image.  You will need a (fast) SD
  card (try SanDisk premium cards) or you can overwrite your current SD card.  Using Windows
  `Win32DiskImager <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/>`_ you can write the image.
