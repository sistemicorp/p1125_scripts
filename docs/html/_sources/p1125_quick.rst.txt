  .. note::

    When P1125 session begins, the CAL button must be pressed before any
    acquisitions can begin.



  .. note::

    Some long `Timespan` values only support `SINGLE` acquisition mode.


Output Controls
---------------

.. index:: Output

.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_out_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Probe Connect/Disconnect - Connect or Disconnect from the DUT.
   The probe must be connected to the P1125 for this button to be accessible.
2. Voltage Slider - Slider to set the Output Voltage.
3. Voltage Quick Sets - Shortcut buttons to adjust voltage up/dn or to a preset value.

Trigger Controls
----------------

.. index:: trigger, D0, D1, A0


Arming the Trigger only affects the (realtime) Log/Lin plots.  Trigger does not
affect the mAhr plot.  Regardless of a trigger, the mAhr plot will always plot.


.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_trig_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Source - Selects the trigger source.
2. Position - Set the time zero position on the plot.
3. Slope - Set the slope of the source waveform which to trigger on.
4. Slider - Adjust the trigger level.  For Log plots the adjustment is within a decade.
5. Left/Right Arrows - Fine level adjustment.
6. Manual Trigger - Press to cause a manual trigger.  This is useful to locate the signal.
7. Text Entry - Enter the trigger level in mAmps.

  .. note::

    Trigger Source will only show the enabled trigger sources, therefore in order to select
    auxiliary input triggers, A0, D0, or D1, they must first be enabled.


Display/Other Controls
----------------------

.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_disp_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Max Y-Axis - Select maximum Y value for the Log/Lin plot areas.
2. Min Y-Axis - Select minimum Y value for the Log/Lin plot areas.
3. ExprtData - Export plot data to a file.  See TBD.
4. ClrMarkers/ClrCursors - Clear Markers, Clear Cursors group.
5. M0/M1/M3 - Memory Group.  Selecting a memory slot will copy the current
   waveform into memory and keep it plotted to allow for comparison.
6. D0/1 Vref - Digital input enable and voltage reference selection.
7. A0 - Set the analog input channel mode.
8. ISINK - Set whether to display sink current.  The p1125 will always sink current, but
   plotting that current is optional with this control.
9. HardConnect - When set, VOUT is applied when CONNECT to the target.  By default
   this setting is disabled and P1125 uses a soft start VOUT CONNECT to avoid high
   in-rush currents.
   *Warning that high in-rush currents are possible with this setting and may trigger source over current.*
