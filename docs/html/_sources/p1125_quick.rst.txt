Acquire Controls
----------------

.. index:: Acquire

.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_acq_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. RUN - Starts continuous acquisitions.
2. SINGLE - Starts a single (one time) acquisition.
3. CAL - Start Calibration.
4. TIMESPAN - Select the desired time span of the acquisition.

  .. note::

    When P1125 session begins, the CAL button must be pressed before any
    acquisitions can begin.



  .. note::

    Some long `Timespan` values only support `SINGLE` acquisition mode.


Output Controls
---------------

.. index:: Output

.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_out_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Probe Connect/Disconnect - Connect or Disconnect from the DUT.
   The probe must be connected to the P1125 for this button to be accessible.
2. Voltage Slider - Slider to set the Output Voltage.
3. Voltage Quick Sets - Shortcut buttons to adjust voltage up/dn or to a preset value.

Trigger Controls
----------------

.. index:: trigger, D0, D1, A0


.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_trig_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Source - Selects the trigger source.
2. Position - Set the time zero position on the plot.
3. Slope - Set the slope of the source waveform which to trigger on.

Trigger Source will only show the enabled trigger sources, therefore in order to select
auxillary input triggers, A0, D0, or D1, they must first be enabled.


Display/Other Controls
----------------------

.. figure:: _static/p1125_main_disp_01.png
    :figwidth: 40%
    :align: right

1. Max Y-Axis - Select maximum Y value for the Log/Lin plot areas.
2. Min Y-Axis - Select minimum Y value for the Log/Lin plot areas.
3. ExprtData - Export plot data to a file.  See TBD.
4. ClrMarkers/ClrCursors - Clear Markers, Clear Cursors group.
5. M0/M1/M3 - Memory Group.  Selecting a memory slot will copy the current
   waveform into memory and keep it plotted to allow for comparison.
6. D0/1 Vref - Digital input enable and voltage reference selection.
7. A0 - Set the analog input channel mode.
8. ISINK - Set whether to display sink current.  The p1125 will always sink current, but
   plotting that current is optional with this control.
9. HardConnect - When set, VOUT is applied when CONNECT to the target.  By default
   this setting is disabled and P1125 uses a soft start VOUT CONNECT to avoid high
   in-rush currents.
   *Warning that high in-rush currents are possible with this setting and may trigger source over current.*
