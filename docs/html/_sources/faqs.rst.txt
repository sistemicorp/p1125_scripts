    Why do I have to CAL (calibrate) the P1125?  What is calibration doing?

.. index:: calibration

* Calibration is applying known internal loads at each voltage in order to
  cancel out any offset in the measurement paths.  These offsets are generally small
  independent of temperature.

    Can the P1125 measure in-rush current?

.. index:: in-rush, soft start

* No, not directly.  The P1125 employs a "soft start" feature which initially sets the output voltage
  to its lowest value, connects to the DUT by switching a relay, and then steps the voltage
  up in 100mV increments until the target voltage is reached.
* You may have a downstream switch that connects the P1125 to your target device.  Note that
  the P1125 will disconnect if the in-rush current exceeds ~1.4 Amps for >= ~5ms.

    When I try to connect probe to the DUT, the P1125 reports a `ISOURCE2` error?

* If the DUT has a high in-rush current, that peak current may trip the P1125
  maximum current safety threshold.
* Often this can be overcome by connecting the again quickly.  The in-rush may be reduced
  from the first insertion.

    How can I wipe WiFi networks and passwords from the P1125?

.. index:: password, WiFi

* Yes. Through the `Admin` menu.


.. code-block:: text

    Can I SSH or remote desktop into the P1125 Raspberry Pi?

.. index:: ssh, remote

* Yes, the P1125 `pi` user password is `pi`.

    Can the p1125 be scripted?

.. index:: scripting

* Yes.
