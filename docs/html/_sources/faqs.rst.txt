    Why do I have to CAL (calibrate) the P1125?  What is calibration doing?

.. index:: calibration

* Calibration is applying known internal loads at each voltage in order to
  cancel out any offset in the (current) measurement paths.  These offsets are generally small and
  independent of temperature.
* VOUT is also being calibrated.

    Can the P1125 measure in-rush current?

.. index:: in-rush, soft start, hard start

* The P1125 employs a "soft start" feature which initially sets the output voltage
  to its lowest value, connects to the DUT by switching a relay, and then steps the voltage
  up in 100mV increments until the target voltage is reached.
* You can enable Hard Connect which bypasses the soft start algorithm. See :ref:`Display/Other Controls`
* You may have a downstream switch that connects the P1125 to your target device.  Note that
  the P1125 will disconnect if the in-rush current exceeds ~3.2 Amps for >= ~5ms.

    When I try to connect probe to the DUT, the P1125 reports a `ISOURCE2` error?

* If the DUT has a high in-rush current, that peak current may trip the P1125
  maximum current safety threshold.
* Often this can be overcome by connecting again quickly.  The in-rush may be reduced
  from the first connection, allowing a subsequent conenction attempt to work.

    How can I wipe WiFi networks and passwords from the P1125?

.. index:: password, WiFi

* Yes. Through the `Admin` menu.

    Can I SSH or remote desktop into the P1125 Raspberry Pi?

.. index:: ssh, remote

* Yes, the P1125 `pi` user password is `pi`.

    Can the p1125 be scripted?

.. index:: scripting

* Yes.  It uses JSON-RPC.  The JSON-RPC API may be accessed via the Main menu.
* See `https://github.com/sistemicorp/p1125_scripts.git <https://github.com/sistemicorp/p1125_scripts.git>`_

    Why can't I use a local monitor, mouse, and keyboard to operate the P1125?

.. index:: scripting

.. index:: local monitor

* Technically you can.  However the user experience is not great.
* The issue is that the internal Raspberry Pi 4B is not powerful enough to run
  `Chromium`, and the UI is sluggish.
* If a fast, compatible browser is ever released for RPi, using a local setup may become an option.
* Until such a time, the local connection setup should only be used for troubleshooting.  For example,
  to find the IP address of the device, or to manually "reset" the SD card.
