Previewing Logs
===============

Logs can be retrieved, when the device is powered, by inserting a USB stick into the P1125.
After inserting the USB stick, wait ~5s and then remove the USB stick and transfer to another PC.
There will be a `p1125` folder on the stick with several logs.

Note that one of the log files is a file with that is the IP address of the P1125.
Using a USB stick to retrieve the logs is one way to find the P1125 IP address.

The P1125 runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B running standard `Dietpi OS <https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/>`_
on an SD card.

It is best practice to shutdown the OS via `Main->Shutdown`.
