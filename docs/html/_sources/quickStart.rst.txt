The P1125 is meant to be used by a remote network connected computer running `Chrome`.

There are two ways to connect remotely to the P1125, wired ethernet and WiFi.  Wired Ethernet
is an easier setup to do.

Wired Ethernet
--------------

1. Insert the SD card into the P1125 SD slot.
2. Simply connect an ethernet cable into the P1125.
3. Attach the included power supply.


WiFi
----

A WiFi connection requires the network to be selected, and if required a password. The
P1125 is based on a Raspberry Pi 4B and runs on the standard RPi OS.  A monitor/keyboard/mouse
can be attached (temporarily) to the P1125 in order to use the RPi OS home screen to
set up WiFi.

Browser
#######

.. index:: browser, connection, Chrome

1. Open a new tab and direct your `Chrome` browser to the hostname as written on the bottom of the P1125,
   for example,

    http://p1125-f85e.local

  .. note::

    The LED must be a constant RED (or GREEN) in order for the browser to connect.  This can
    take up to a minute after power has been connected.

  .. note::

    `f85e` will be different for your P1125, see the label on the bottom of the P1125.

  .. note::

    Only the Google Chrome browser is officially supported.


2. If everything has gone well, the P1125 Start screen should appear,
