Remote Connection
#################

The P1125 is meant to be used by a remote network connected computer running `Chrome`.  There are two ways
to connect remotely to the P1125, wired ethernet and WiFi.


With either connection method, the P1125 hostname should be noted from the label on the bottom
of the case.  This is how you will address the P1125.

LED Status
----------

.. index:: LED, status

The Status of the P1125 is given by the LED on the top.

+------------+---------------------------------+
| LED        | Meaning                         |
+============+=================================+
| OFF        | Shutdown, Power can be removed  |
+------------+---------------------------------+
| RED        | Booting Up, or otherwise BUSY.  |
| Blink      | Attempt to connect via Browser  |
|            | will fail                       |
+------------+---------------------------------+
| Amber      | P1125 has entered HOTSPOT Mode. |
| Blink      | Connect with Phone, PC, etc.    |
|            | Select Network and enter        |
|            | credentials.                    |
+------------+---------------------------------+
| RED        | P1125 is Ready and Connected    |
|            | to a network (either WiFi or    |
|            | or wired)                       |
+------------+---------------------------------+


.. note::

    On Power Up, the P1125 can take up to 60 seconds to update the LED status.

.. note::

    The p1125 depends on mDNS support on the network.  Mac/Linux computers support mDNS
    but Windows computers may not.  Consider installing "Bonjour for Windows" (Google it)
    to use `hostname` lookup for the P1125 browser connection.


Wired Ethernet
--------------

1. Simply connect an ethernet cable into the P1125.
2. Attach the included power supply.
3. The LED will blink RED for ~60 seconds and eventually be solid RED.
4. When the LED is solid RED, the P1125 is ready to be accessed by your browser (see below).


WiFi
----

.. note::

    Due to the amount of data plotted, WiFi connections are not recommended.

1. Attach the WiFi antennae. Attach the included power supply.
2. Nothing should be plugged into the wired ethernet port.  The P1125 will use the wired
   connection first if its available.
3. On first use, the P1125 does not know your WiFi name or credentials to log in.  Therefore
   after the initial ~60secs while its booting up, the LED will start to blink Amber.
4. Wait for the LED to blink AMBER.
5. When the P1125 LED is blinking AMBER it has setup a HOTSPOT to get WiFi credentials. Use
   your phone, PC, tablet, etc, to access the HOTSPOT.  The name of the HOTSPOT will be in the form
   `p1125-####` and match the label on the bottom of the P1125.
6. Using your phone, PC, etc, Connect to the HOTSOT and select your network and enter password and then CONNECT.
7. The P1125 LED should change to solid RED after ~10 seconds of attempting to connect to the WiFi network.
   If it goes back to HOSTPOT (Blinking AMBER) then retry, and be careful about entering the password.
8. When the LED is solid RED, the P1125 is ready to be accessed by your browser (see below).

The Next time you power up the P1125 it will know your network and you do not have to repeat the
HOTSPOT setup.


.. note::

    WiFi credentials can be removed from the P1125 via the `Admin` menu.


Browser
#######

.. index:: browser, connection, Chrome

1. Open a new tab and direct your `Chrome` browser to the hostname as written on the bottom of the P1125,
   for example,

    * http://p1125-f85e.local or
    * p1125-f85e.local/  or
    * p1125-f85e/  (Windows only)


  .. note::

    The LED must be a constant RED in order for the browser to connect.  This can
    take up to a minute after power has been connected.

  .. note::

    `f85e` will be different for your P1125, see the label on the bottom of the P1125.

  .. note::

    Only the Google Chrome browser is officially supported.


2. If everything has gone well, the P1125 Start screen should appear,

3. Bookmark this page.
4. Press the START button to enter the application.

Connection Troubleshooting
##########################

Opps, something went wrong.


.. code-block:: text

    The status LED is solid RED, but browser cannot connect.

* The P1125 is on a network, as indicated by the solid RED LED.  However, hostname lookup is not
  working as expected, probably due to a failure of mDNS.
* The workaround is to get the IP address of the P1125.  The P1125 itself does not have a display,
  but it will write out the IP address that it has on a USB stick if one is inserted into it.
* Insert a USB stick into the P1125 while it is powered up and the LED is solid RED.
* After about 10 seconds, remove the USB stick and open it on another computer.  There will be a
  `p1125` folder, and in that folder there will be a file with a name that is the IP address.
* Use the found IP address in your browser.
* Alternatively you can connect to your router and review the list of devices, and get the IP address from there.
* Alternatively you can connect a monitor to the P1125, there is a troubleshooting HDMI cable in the kit,
  also connect mouse/keyboard, and then power up the P1125.  The monitor must be connected before power
  is connected.  Open a terminal, and issue command `ifconfig` to find the IP address


.. code-block:: text

    Hostname variations, that pesky backslash, and Windows

* if the hostname is failing, it could be the format of the hostname entered in the browser.
* You must either enter the prefix "`http://`" or, add the "`/`" to the end of the hostname.
* On Windows, it sometimes works if you exclude "`.local`" in the hostname.


.. code-block:: text

    What is mDNS, and can I fix it?

* mDNS is mobile DNS and its a service for finding devices on your network by their hostname.
* mDNS can be running anywhere, on your router, on your PC, etc.
* mDNS is sometimes called the "Bonjour" service from Apple, or "avahi" the open source service.
* Mac and Linux computers by default support mDNS.
* Windows may or may not have mDNS service, depending on installed programs.
  * You can install "Bonjour services for Windows", with this link,
  * https://support.apple.com/kb/dl999
