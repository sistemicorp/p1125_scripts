JSON Config File
----------------
Various aspects of the P1125 can be configured via the `app_config.json` file located in the `/home/user/pi`
directory.

Although these settings can be accessed through the `Presets` page, another way to alter the application
configuration is to `ssh` into the P1125 and edit the `app_config.json` file with the `nano` editor.

How to `ssh` into the P1125, the pi user password is `pi`,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh pi@p1125-####.local


.. note::

    The P1125 `pi` user password is `pi`.


.. note::

    The hostname of your P1125 is written on the label on the bottom of the device.  Replace `####`
    with your specific hostname.


Then edit the file,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ nano app_config.json


The `app_config.json` will look similar to this,

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "presets": {
        "vout_0": 2900,
        "vout_1": 3400,
        "vout_2": 4700
      }
    }
