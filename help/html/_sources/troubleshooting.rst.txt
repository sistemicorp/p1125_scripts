    The Chrome Browser is unable to connect


* The P1125 LED must be solid RED in order for the browser to connect.
* Is the LED on the P1125 blinking ORANGE?  If the blinking ORANGE does not stop after
  about a minute from power up, a fatal error has occurred.  You may try and remove
  power, wait 10seconds and then re-apply power.
* Is the LED off? If so, remove power for 10seconds and then re-apply power.
* Confirm the P1125 is connected to the same network as your remote computer.

  * Try to `ping` the P1125
