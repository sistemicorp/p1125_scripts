mAhr Plot
#########

The P1125 `mAhr` plot is very useful for acquiring long running plots and estimating battery life.

.. note::

    For `very` long running acquisitions, scripts are recommended.

1. The mAhr plot is accessed via the plot tabs.

  While an acquisition is running, the user may toggle between the plot tabs.

2. The statistics from the acquisition will be shown here.
3. The Stop Time for the mAhr plot is selected.

.. note::

    To get the most accurate estimation of your battery life, the Stop Time
    should be set to a time that captures the "life cycle" of your target.
    For example, if your target wakes up once a minute to "work", then perhaps
    a Stop Time of 10min would capture enough life cycles to calculate a good
    average current.


4. The RUN command begins mAhr data acquisition.


* The mAhr plot is always running as a background task.
* If you are not interested in the mAhr plot, its best to set the Stop Time to 30 seconds.
* While the mAhr acquisition is running the realtime Log/Lin plots will be running.
  If you are not interested in the realtime plots, its best to keep the timespan setting small.


Acquisition Details
-------------------

* The P1125 is ALWAYS sampling at one rate, that is `39063 Hertz`.
* The current sampled at the sampling rate is integrated over ~400 samples, which is ~10.47ms.
* Every sample on the mahr plot is the average current for that time period.
* Therefore "fast" wakeup/radio events on the target device are captured in this average current.
* The mAhr plot is updated ~200 samples of ~10.47ms, which is ~2.1 seconds.


Battery Life
------------

An example mAhr plot is acquired with the `Demo` mode.

1. At the end of 30 seconds, the mAhr statistics are shown.
2. Here the mAhr calculation is `0.2 mAhr`.
3. To estimate your battery life, divide your battery mAhr rating by `0.2`.
